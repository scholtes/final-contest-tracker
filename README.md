**Note** Tested with `python3` and `Matlab R2013a`.  Will probably work with other versions of `Matlab`, will probably *NOT* work with `python2`.  

Steps:

1. Run `python trackscores.py 1` - (note: if you have to stop and restart it, change the `1` to the last number it was on)  
2. Open `Matlab`, navigate to the `logs/` directory, and run `dographs.m`
